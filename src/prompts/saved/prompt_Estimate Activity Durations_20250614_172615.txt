You are a PMP exam question generator. Generate EXACTLY 25 unique, high-quality, scenario-based PMP-style multiple-choice questions for the process: Estimate Activity Durations (Process Group: Planning).

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - EXACT QUESTION COUNT:
- You MUST generate EXACTLY 25 questions - NO MORE, NO LESS
- Do not generate fewer than 25 questions
- Do not generate more than 25 questions
- This is a strict requirement that must be followed precisely
- The JSON output must contain exactly 25 questions in the "questions" array

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - ALWAYS FOUR OPTIONS:
- EVERY question MUST have exactly 4 options: A, B, C, and D
- NEVER create questions with fewer or more than 4 options
- ALL options must be labeled as OPTION_A, OPTION_B, OPTION_C, and OPTION_D
- This is a strict requirement that cannot be violated

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - QUESTION STYLE VARIETY:
- Use DIFFERENT PMP question styles and formats for each question
- Do NOT follow the same question pattern or structure for all questions
- Vary the question types, scenarios, and presentation styles
- Include a mix of:
  * "What should the project manager do NEXT?" questions
  * "Which tool or technique is MOST appropriate?" questions
  * "What is the BEST approach?" questions
  * "Which document should be updated?" questions
  * "What is the MOST likely cause?" questions
  * "Which process should be performed?" questions
  * "What is the CORRECT sequence?" questions
  * "Which stakeholder should be consulted?" questions
  * "What is the PRIMARY purpose?" questions
  * "Which metric should be monitored?" questions
- Vary the scenario complexity, industry context, and project types
- Use different sentence structures, question lengths, and complexity levels
- Ensure each question feels unique and distinct from others

DIFFICULTY DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT:
- Generate EXACTLY 20 DIFFICULT questions (80% of 25)
- Generate EXACTLY 5 EASY questions (20% of 25)
- The total must equal 25 questions

DIFFICULT QUESTIONS REQUIREMENTS:
- Must test deep understanding of PMP concepts
- Must have TWO OPTIONS THAT ARE SO CLOSE that candidates will struggle to distinguish between them
- These two close options should be very similar in wording, concept, or approach
- Only ONE of these two close options should be correct
- The other close option should be incorrect but extremely plausible and tempting
- The remaining two options should be clearly incorrect but still plausible
- The challenge should be in identifying the subtle difference that makes one correct and the other incorrect
- Focus on complex scenarios, edge cases, or nuanced PMBOK concepts where the distinction is subtle

EASY QUESTIONS REQUIREMENTS:
- Test basic understanding of PMP concepts
- All options should be clearly distinguishable
- Focus on fundamental concepts and straightforward scenarios

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Each question must be realistic, relevant, and test a specific concept from the process.
- Each question must have exactly 4 unique, plausible options (A, B, C, D) - NO EXCEPTIONS.
- Only one option must be correct, and the correct answer must be randomly distributed among A/B/C/D (i.e. the correct answer must be randomly placed as OPTION_A, OPTION_B, OPTION_C, or OPTION_D). Do not always place the correct answer in the same position (for example, do not always put the correct answer as OPTION_A).
- Each option must be a complete sentence and not reused across questions.
- Each question must include detailed explanations for all options:
    - CORRECT: Start with "CORRECT - ", explain why it's correct, reference PMBOK/PMI best practices, and provide real-world context (3-4 sentences).
    - INCORRECT: Start with "INCORRECT - ", explain why it's wrong, reference PMI concepts, and describe negative impacts (3-4 sentences).
- Explanations must be unique, detailed, and never generic or repeated.
- Each question must include an analysis section with:
    - process_group (must be one of: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, Closing)
    - knowledge_area (must be one of: Integration, Scope, Schedule, Cost, Quality, Resources, Communications, Risk, Procurement, Stakeholders) (for this process, use: Schedule)
    - tool (if applicable)
    - suggested_read (2-3 specific PMBOK/PMI resources)
    - concepts_to_understand (concise, max 150 words)
    - additional_notes (quick read links or "No quick reads available for this process")
    - difficulty_level (must be either "difficult" or "easy")

Output must be valid JSON, following this format:
