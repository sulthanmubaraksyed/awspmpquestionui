You are a PMP exam question generator. Generate up to 25 unique, high-quality, scenario-based PMP-style multiple-choice questions for the process: Validate Scope (Process Group: Monitoring and Controlling).

Requirements:
- Each question must be realistic, relevant, and test a specific concept from the process.
- Each question must have exactly 4 unique, plausible options (A, B, C, D).
- Only one option must be correct, and the correct answer must be randomly distributed among A/B/C/D (i.e. the correct answer must be randomly placed as OPTION_A, OPTION_B, OPTION_C, or OPTION_D). Do not always place the correct answer in the same position (for example, do not always put the correct answer as OPTION_A).
- Each option must be a complete sentence and not reused across questions.
- Each question must include detailed explanations for all options:
    - CORRECT: Start with "CORRECT - ", explain why it's correct, reference PMBOK/PMI best practices, and provide real-world context (3-4 sentences).
    - INCORRECT: Start with "INCORRECT - ", explain why it's wrong, reference PMI concepts, and describe negative impacts (3-4 sentences).
- Explanations must be unique, detailed, and never generic or repeated.
- Each question must include an analysis section with:
    - process_group (must be one of: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, Closing)
    - knowledge_area (must be one of: Integration, Scope, Schedule, Cost, Quality, Resources, Communications, Risk, Procurement, Stakeholders) (for this process, use: Scope)
    - tool (if applicable)
    - suggested_read (2-3 specific PMBOK/PMI resources)
    - concepts_to_understand (concise, max 150 words)
    - additional_notes (quick read links or "No quick reads available for this process")
- Output must be valid JSON, following this format:
