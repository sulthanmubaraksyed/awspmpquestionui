Question 17

A project manager is working on a financial system implementation project for a government company. One of the key stakeholders who uses predictive approaches is not like virtual tools such as chats, task trackers, and so forth. They prefer email, telephone calls, and face-to-face meetings.
How should the project manager approach this situation?
Use regular screen-sharing sessions to show the progress to the stakeholder.
Explanation

While screen-sharing can be useful, it still falls under virtual tools, which the stakeholder does not prefer.
Correct answer
Align and agree with the stakeholder on the communication approach.
Explanation

Aligning and agreeing with the stakeholder on the communication approach is the most effective strategy. It respects the stakeholder's preferences and ensures effective communication, which is key to successful project management and stakeholder satisfaction.
Ask the manager to use virtual communication tools and online dashboards.
Explanation

This goes against the stakeholder's expressed preferences and might lead to disengagement or dissatisfaction.
Create a digital dashboard to meet the manager's information needs.
Explanation

Again, this involves using a virtual tool that the stakeholder is not comfortable with. While it can be a useful method, it should not be the primary mode of communication unless the stakeholder agrees to it.
Overall explanation
In managing a financial system implementation project where a key stakeholder prefers traditional communication methods over virtual tools, the project manager needs to find a balance between effective project management practices and accommodating stakeholder preferences. The best choice is to align and agree with the stakeholders on the communication approach. This is crucial for several reasons:
Understand Stakeholder Preferences: Acknowledge the stakeholder's preference for emails, telephone calls, and face-to-face meetings. Understanding their comfort zone in communication is crucial for effective stakeholder engagement.
Customize Communication: Align the communication strategy to meet the stakeholder's preferences. This may involve more personalized communication methods like scheduled calls or meetings, and using emails for updates and information sharing.
Build Strong Relationships: Tailoring the communication approach helps in building a stronger relationship with the stakeholder, ensuring they feel heard and valued, which is essential for project success.

Question 18


After the merger of two large companies, a project manager is assigned to a project. The company hires a consultant to ensure best practices are being used in information security. During an iteration, the consultant requests changes to a software component, claiming that it is not meeting market requirements.
What should the project manager do?
Continue the iteration and add the requested changes.
Explanation

Adding changes without reviewing them with the customer could lead to scope creep and might not align with the customer's priorities or project objectives.

Explanation

While reviewing tasks can provide insights into the execution of the project, it does not directly address the concern of not delivering business value.
Review the project management plan budget with the stakeholders.
Explanation

The budget review is important for financial analysis but may not fully address the issue of business value realization.
Correct answer
Review the business benefits realization plan with the stakeholders.
Explanation

Reviewing the business benefits realization plan with the stakeholders is the most effective way to address the concern. It allows for a focused discussion on the expected and actual business outcomes of the project, facilitating a deeper understanding of the reasons behind the perceived lack of success in delivering business value.
Review the communications management plan with the stakeholders,
Explanation

Although communication is a key aspect of any project, reviewing the communications plan in this context might not directly address the concern regarding the realization of business value.
Overall explanation
When a stakeholder expresses that a project did not deliver the expected business value during a lessons learned workshop, the project manager must address this concern thoroughly. The focus should be on understanding why the stakeholder perceives the project as unsuccessful in terms of business value. The best choice is to review the business benefits realization plan with the stakeholders. This is crucial for several reasons:
Focus on Business Value: Review the business benefits realization plan with the stakeholders. This involves discussing how the project outcomes were intended to achieve specific business benefits and assessing whether and why these benefits were not fully realized.
Identify Gaps and Misalignments: This review helps in identifying any gaps between the project’s deliverables and the expected business value. It provides insights into whether the project goals were misaligned with the business objectives or if there were shortcomings in the execution.

Reject the workload back to the global team.
Explanation

While it’s important to maintain scope boundaries, outright rejection without understanding the cause might lead to unresolved issues and tension within the team.
Assess the team's capacity to absorb the workload.
Explanation

Although assessing the team's capacity is important, it should not be the first step. Understanding the cause of the conflict should precede decisions about workload absorption.
Correct answer
Evaluate and understand the cause of the conflict.
Explanation

Evaluating and understanding the cause of the conflict is the most constructive and effective initial step. It focuses on addressing the root of the problem and fostering clear communication and understanding among all teams involved in the project, thereby enhancing collaboration and efficiency.
Escalate the situation to the project sponsor.
Explanation

Escalation is a viable option but should be considered after attempts to understand and resolve the issue at the project team level. Premature escalation can sometimes escalate conflicts instead of resolving them.
Overall explanation
In a situation where a project manager, part of a global project team, is receiving scope requests that the global team should handle, the appropriate course of action needs to balance scope management, team capacity, and effective communication. The best choice is to evaluate and understand the cause of the conflict. This is crucial for several reasons:
Understand the Underlying Issues: The project manager should first evaluate and understand why these requests are directed to their team instead of the global one. This involves analyzing the reasons behind the misdirection of workload and any potential misunderstandings or miscommunications about the scope division.
Clarify Scope and Responsibilities: After understanding the cause of the issue, it's important to reiterate and clarify the scope and responsibilities of the local and global teams. Ensuring that all parties clearly understand their respective roles can help prevent similar issues in the future.

In a situation where a significant regulatory feature is discovered to be missing from the project backlog in a laboratory's new product launch, the project manager needs to address this oversight promptly and effectively. The best course of action would be to ask the product owner to add the missing feature in the backlog. This is a crucial step because:
Backlog Prioritization: The product owner is responsible for managing the project backlog, including prioritizing features based on their importance and value. Adding the regulatory feature to the backlog ensures that it is considered and prioritized appropriately within the scope of the project.
Compliance with Regulations: Since the missing feature is regulatory, it is likely critical for the project’s compliance and success. Including it in the backlog is essential to ensure the project meets all necessary regulatory standards.
Structured Approach to Scope Management: Adding the feature to the backlog allows for a structured approach to integrating this new requirement into the project plan and iterations.

Question 23

A project manager is managing a project to deploy new software to 200 end users. During the implementation, there is a missed process that caused some of the users to lose their computer data.
What should the project manager do first?
Correct answer
Meet with the team to discuss the root cause and encourage the team to take note of it and continue to focus on the deployment.
Explanation

Discussing the root cause with the team and maintaining focus on deployment offers a balanced and effective approach. It ensures immediate attention to the critical issue at hand while also keeping the team aligned with the overall project objectives.
Record this case until the final lessons learned session is complete to prevent impacting the team's morale during implementation.
Explanation

Recording this case until the final lessons learned session delays addressing the issue, which could lead to further problems and does not help in immediate rectification for the affected users. Immediate action is necessary in situations involving data loss.
Meet with the team members and request they conduct a review of the case by providing feedback as lessons learned.
Explanation

Meeting with the team members to conduct a review and request feedback is important, but it should come after a root cause analysis. Additionally, this option does not emphasize the need to maintain focus on ongoing project activities.
Invite a consultant to review the process in order not to repeat the same issue and share the results with the team.
Explanation

Inviting a consultant to review the process might be beneficial for a detailed analysis, but it is not the first action to take. Immediate internal review and corrective actions are essential before seeking external advice.
Overall explanation
In a scenario where a missed process during software deployment results in data loss for some users, the project manager should first meet with the team to discuss the root cause of this issue. Understanding what went wrong is crucial to prevent similar incidents and take immediate corrective action. While addressing this, the project manager should encourage the team to continue focusing on the deployment, ensuring the project stays on track. This approach balances the need for immediate problem-solving with the ongoing requirements of the project, promoting both responsiveness to issues and continuity in project execution.
NOTE: Both options A and C focus on internal team responses, but they differ in how they approach the issue:
Option A (Discuss Root Cause and Continue Focus): This option involves meeting with the team to discuss the root cause and encouraging the team to note the issue but continue to focus on deployment. The emphasis here is on identifying the cause while maintaining progress on the project. However, this option does not explicitly address corrective actions for the current situation or the impact on affected users.
Option C (Conduct a Review and Lessons Learned): This option focuses on meeting with team members to review the case and gather lessons learned. It implies a more reflective approach, emphasizing understanding and learning from mistakes. Like Option A, it does not explicitly mention addressing the immediate impact on affected users, but it does focus on internal team learning and improvement.
Combining these approaches could be most effective considering the immediate need to address both the root cause and the impact on affected users. However, since the question requires choosing the best single option, the priority should be to first understand what went wrong and how to prevent it from reoccurring while also considering the ongoing project activities.
Given these considerations, Option A might be slightly more appropriate as it directly focuses on understanding the root cause while maintaining progress on the project, which is crucial in a situation where ongoing deployment occurs. However, it's important to note that any chosen option should be supplemented with additional actions, including addressing the impact on affected users and implementing immediate corrective measures.

Question 24

A project team member, who is inexperienced in system development work is not performing well. Currently, there are no other staff members available who are qualified to complete the work.
What should the project manager do?
