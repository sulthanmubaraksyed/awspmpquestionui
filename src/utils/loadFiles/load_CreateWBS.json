                "option_a_result": "INCORRECT - While stakeholder identification is important, it's not the primary purpose of the WBS. The WBS focuses on breaking down the project scope into manageable components, not on identifying stakeholders.",
                "option_b_result": "CORRECT - The primary purpose of the WBS is to break down the project scope into smaller, more manageable components. This hierarchical decomposition helps in organizing and defining the total scope of the project, making it easier to plan, execute, monitor, and control the project work.",
                "option_c_result": "INCORRECT - While the WBS provides a foundation for scheduling, its primary purpose is not to establish the project schedule. The WBS focuses on scope decomposition, and the schedule is developed later using the WBS as an input.",
                "option_d_result": "INCORRECT - While the WBS provides a basis for cost estimation, its primary purpose is not to define the project budget. The WBS focuses on scope decomposition, and cost estimates are developed later using the WBS as an input.",

                "concepts_to_understand": "The 'Create WBS' process is about breaking down the total project scope into manageable pieces. Its core purpose is to ensure that all work necessary to achieve project objectives is identified, defined, and organized. This systematic decomposition results in work packages, which are the lowest level of the WBS where work can be reliably estimated, scheduled, and controlled. This clarity in scope is crucial for preventing scope creep, ensuring comprehensive planning, and providing a solid baseline for project execution and monitoring.",
